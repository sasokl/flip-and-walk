## flip-and-walk

### Developed by the Fire Ducks (Ivan M. - designer, Alexander B. - web dev student, Ioannis P. - web dev student).

#### Our idea was the creation of a social media traveling network, where users would be able to upload travel-related short videos or photos, along with descriptions, hashtags, location reviews and so much more! We enjoyed working together and sharing ideas, and we are all looking forward to collaborating further in the future!
