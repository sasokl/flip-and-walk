## flip-and-walk

### Developed by the Fire Ducks (Ivan M. - designer, Alexander B. - web dev student, Ioannis P. - web dev student).

#### Our idea was the creation of a social media traveling network, where users would be able to upload travel-related short videos, along with descriptions, hashtags, location reviews and so much more!

#### The purpose of the app is to demonstrate to users the beautiful landmarks and areas within their country. That way, they can choose a place to travel domestically, despite the imposed COVID-19 restrictions.

#### We enjoyed working together and sharing ideas, and we are all looking forward to collaborating further in the future!
